Welcome to Xsection documentation page!
=======================================

Xsection is a command line(ish) Python-written script for creation of important geometry data in 1D hydraulic modelling.
It's main purpose is creation and preparation of cross-sectional and longitudinal river profiles for their use in 1D
hydraulic modelling. Program is heavily inspired by DHI's proprietary plugin, called Mike 11 GIS and therefore mostly
intended for Mike by DHI software users.

By using script, you can create cross section profiles from different elevation sources:

* Digital terrain models (DEMs)
* Terrestrial geodetic point surveying

The following documentation will get you through the installation process and program usage.

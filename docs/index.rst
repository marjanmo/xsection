Xsection is a command line(ish) Python-written script for creation of important geometry data in 1D hydraulic modelling.
Its most important result is a text file, containing cross sectional data in format, that is directly importable in
Mike 11 by DHI cross section editor. Program is heavily inspired by DHI's proprietary plugin, called Mike 11 GIS and
therefore mostly intended for Mike by DHI software users.



By using script, you can create cross section profiles from different elevation sources:

* Digital terrain models (DEM)
* Terrestrial geodetic point surveying

The following documentation will get you through the installation process and program usage:
